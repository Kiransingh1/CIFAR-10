Twitter Sentiment Analysis Overview Twitter Sentiment Analysis is a real-time automated machine-learning technique designed to determine and categorize the subjective context of tweets. By analyzing the psychological intent behind tweets, the system classifies them as positive, negative, or neutral. This involves Opinion Mining to understand the sentiment expressed in a tweet, providing valuable insights into public opinion and trends.

Features Real-time sentiment analysis of Twitter data Categorizes tweets into positive, negative, or neutral sentiments Uses machine learning techniques for accurate sentiment detection Provides insights into public opinion and trends Requirements Python 3.x Tweepy TextBlob Pandas Scikit-learn Matplotlib (optional, for visualization) Installation Clone the repository:

bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/yourusername/twitter-sentiment-analysis.git cd twitter-sentiment-analysis Install the required Python packages:

bash Copy code pip install -r requirements.txt Set up Twitter API credentials:

Create a Twitter Developer account and create a new application to obtain your API keys and tokens. Create a config.py file in the project root directory and add your Twitter API credentials: python Copy code CONSUMER_KEY = 'your_consumer_key' CONSUMER_SECRET = 'your_consumer_secret' ACCESS_TOKEN = 'your_access_token' ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET = 'your_access_token_secret' Usage Run the sentiment analysis script:

bash Copy code python sentiment_analysis.py The system will start fetching tweets in real-time based on specified keywords or hashtags, analyze their sentiment, and categorize them as positive, negative, or neutral.

Optionally, you can visualize the sentiment distribution using Matplotlib:
