CIFAR-10 Dataset
Overview
The CIFAR-10 (Canadian Institute For Advanced Research) dataset is a collection of images widely used for machine learning and computer vision algorithms. Developed by researchers at the CIFAR institute, it consists of 60,000 32x32 color images categorized into 10 different classes. This dataset is popular for training and evaluating image recognition models due to its diversity and size.

Features
Contains 60,000 color images of 32x32 pixels each
Divided into 10 classes, with 6,000 images per class
Provides a benchmark for image classification algorithms
Widely used in academic research and industry applications
Classes
The CIFAR-10 dataset includes the following classes:

Airplane
Automobile
Bird
Cat
Deer
Dog
Frog
Horse
Ship
Truck
Each class contains 6,000 images, with 5,000 for training and 1,000 for testing.

Installation
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/cifar-10-dataset.git
cd cifar-10-dataset
Install the required Python packages:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Download the CIFAR-10 dataset:

You can download the CIFAR-10 dataset from the official website or directly from this link. Extract the files and place them in the data directory of the project.

Usage
Load and preprocess the dataset:

python
Copy code
from utils import load_cifar10
train_data, train_labels, test_data, test_labels = load_cifar10('data/cifar-10-batches-py')
Train your machine learning model on the CIFAR-10 dataset:

python
Copy code
from model import MyModel
model = MyModel()
model.train(train_data, train_labels)
Evaluate your model on the test set:

python
Copy code
accuracy = model.evaluate(test_data, test_labels)
print(f'Test Accuracy: {accuracy:.2f}%')
